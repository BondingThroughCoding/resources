# Heading Tag Guide

A quick guide to using HTML heading tags from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

## Introduction

HTML heading tags are used to define headings in a document. They range from `<h1>` (the most important) to `<h6>` (the least important). Proper use of headings helps structure your content and improve accessibility.

## Examples of Heading Tags

### Heading 1: `<h1>`

# This is an `<h1>` heading

The `<h1>` tag represents the main title or most important heading in a document.

### Heading 2: `<h2>`

## This is an `<h2>` heading

The `<h2>` tag is used for secondary headings, often representing sections under the main heading.

### Heading 3: `<h3>`

### This is an `<h3>` heading

The `<h3>` tag is used for sub-sections under an `<h2>` heading.

### Heading 4: `<h4>`

#### This is an `<h4>` heading

The `<h4>` tag is typically used for sub-sub-sections under an `<h3>` heading.

### Heading 5: `<h5>`

##### This is an `<h5>` heading

The `<h5>` tag is used for even smaller sub-sections.

### Heading 6: `<h6>`

###### This is an `<h6>` heading

The `<h6>` tag is the smallest and least important heading level.

## Best Practices

- Use only one `<h1>` per page for the main title.
- Structure content hierarchically, using `<h2>` for main sections, `<h3>` for sub-sections, and so on.
- Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., donâ€™t jump from `<h2>` to `<h4>`).
- Use headings to improve readability and SEO.

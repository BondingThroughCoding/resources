# Understanding the `<title>` Tag: Naming Your Webpage

The `<title>` tag is how you name your webpage. Itâ€™s a small but important part of your website, and it tells both visitors and browsers what your page is all about.

## What is the `<title>` Tag?

The `<title>` tag is used to give your webpage a name. This name appears:
- On the browser tab at the top of your screen.
- As the clickable title in search engine results.
- When you bookmark a webpage.

The `<title>` tag goes inside the `<head>` section of your HTML.

### Example:
```html
<head>
  <title>My Awesome Website</title>
</head>
```
When someone visits your website, they'll see "My Awesome Website" on the browser tab.

### Why is it important?
The <title> tag is important because:

- It helps visitors know what your page is about before they even look at it.
- It helps search engines, like Google, understand your page and display it in search results.
- It makes your webpage look professional by giving it a proper name.

### What Makes a Good Title?
A good title should:

- Be short and clear.
- Describe the content of the page.
- Be interesting so people want to click on it.

Example of Good Titles:
- "Learn HTML: A Beginner's Guide"
- "How to Style Webpages with CSS"
- "Fun Coding Projects for Kids"

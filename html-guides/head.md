# Understanding the `<head>` Tag: The Brain of Your Webpage

The `<head>` tag is one of the most important parts of an HTML webpage. It holds all the information about the webpage that isn't directly shown to visitors, but is crucial for how the page behaves.


### Here's what you'll typically find inside the `<head>` tag:
- **Title of the page** – This is what appears on the tab in your browser.
- **Links to CSS** – This connects your webpage to its styles, which define how it looks.
- **Metadata** – Information like the page’s description for search engines.

### Example:
```html
<head>
  <title>My Awesome Webpage</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <meta charset="UTF-8">  
</head>
```
### Why is it important?
The `<head>` tag might not be visible on the webpage itself, but it's essential for how the page works behind the scenes. It helps web browsers, search engines, and even social media know how to interact with your site!

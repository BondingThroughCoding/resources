# List Style Type

List style type is used to determine the style of the dots in the list. If you want the list to have bullet points, dashes or nothing at all, you can change that here! Some sorts of values include `none`, `disc` or `circle`. 

## Example

Here's an example of how I can change the default list style type from `disc` to none. 

```css
ul {
    list-style-type: none; 
}
```

If you want to know more about the `list-style-type` feature, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_list-style-type.php). Both of these sites give excellent examples of how the list style type property works, with plenty of examples on how to use it, and how the feature looks on a website.

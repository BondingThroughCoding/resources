# Font Size

`font-size` is pretty self explanatory. Its used to change the size of the text. We normally determine this by using pixels `px` to tell the computer how large or small we want the text to be. The number must be greater that 1, and is usually less than 100, but it can definitely be larger than that if you want it to!

## Example

Once again, we usually place the `font-size` property inside a selector: 

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 20px; 
}

```

If you want to know more about the `font-size` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_size.asp). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the font-size CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

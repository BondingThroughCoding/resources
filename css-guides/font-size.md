# Font Size

`font-size` is pretty self explanatory. Its used to change the size of the text. We normally determine this by using pixels `px` to tell the computer how large or small we want the text to be. The number must be greater that 1, and is usually less than 100, but it can definitely be larger than that if you want it to!

## Example

Once again, we usually place the `font-size` property inside a selector: 

```
h1 {
    font-size: 20px; 
}

```

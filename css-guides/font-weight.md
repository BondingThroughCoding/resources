# Font Weight

`font-weight` is similar to `font-family` in the sense that both are used to alter the appearence of text on a page. `font-weight` is used to control how heavy our font appears on the page. For example, it usually appears like this text, but increasing the font weight changes the text to look like **this**. 

## Example

To increase the heaviness of the text in a paragraph, it might look like this: 

```
h1 {
    font-weight: 20px; 
}

p {
    font-weight: 5px; 
}

```

# Font Weight

`font-weight` is similar to `font-family` in the sense that both are used to alter the appearence of text on a page. `font-weight` is used to control how heavy our font appears on the page. For example, it usually appears like this text, but increasing the font weight changes the text to look like **this**. 

## Example

To increase the heaviness of the text in a paragraph, it might look like this: 

```css
h1 {
    font-weight: 20px; 
}

p {
    font-weight: 5px; 
}

```

If you want to know more about the `font-weight` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_weight.php). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the font-weight CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

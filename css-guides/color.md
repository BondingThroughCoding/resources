# Color

`color` is used to change the color of the text! You can change this by giving the code the name of a color i.e. white, yellow, green, or you can give it something fancier called a hex code! Hex codes are more specific, and allow you to access a wider range of colors. You can also give it rgb values, which are 3 different values that have to be between 0 and 255, but we will mainly stick to words and hex values. 

# Example

If I wanted my text and header to have two different colors, I might do something like this!

```css
h1{
    color: pink; 
}

p{
    color: #000000
}
```

If you want to know more about the `color` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the color CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

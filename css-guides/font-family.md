# Font Family

`font-family` is very useful for stylising your page and making it unique, as it can change the font's on your page. This allows you to create unique websites, and use fonts that fit your website's design. For example, if I wanted to make something computing based, I would use the Courier font, but if I wanted something professional, I would use Georgia. What font you choose is completely up to you!

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `font-family` CSS property" 

```
h1, p {
    font-family: Georgia, serif; 
}

```

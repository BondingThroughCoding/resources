# Border Radius
`border radius` is often used for objects that have a border. This can be the border of a textbox, or the border of an image. By increasing the value of border-radius, you can round the edges. The larger the value, the rounder the borders are, eventually leading to a circle! We can pass both pixels and percentages to the `border-radius` property. 

## Example 

Here's an example on how I might alter the `border-radius` on an image. 

```css
img {
    border-radius: 20px; 
}
```

Border radius is really useful if you want to make the edges of a box easier to look at!

If you want to know more about the `border-radius` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.php). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the border-radius CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

# Text Decoration

`text-decoration` is used to add features such as underlines, linethroughs, and wavy lines (just to name a few) to sections of text. This works like the `<u> </u>` tags in HTML - its basically just the CSS version of the HTML tags! It also has a sub property called `text-decoration-color`!

### Text Decoration Color

`text-decoration-color` allows you to change the color of the underline, wavyline, or whatever stye of text decoration you have used within your CSS stylesheet. Similar to `color`, you can determine the color of the decoration by by giving the property the name of a color i.e. white, yellow, green, or you can give it something fancier called a hex code! See the `color` page to grab some more info on this property.

## Example

Here's an example of how `text-decoration` and `text-decoration-color` can be used in a CSS stylesheet!

```css
h2 {
    text-decoration: underline; 
    text-decoration-color: pink; 
}
```

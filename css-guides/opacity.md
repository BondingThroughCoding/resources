# Opacity 

Opacity is a CSS rule that allows us to make objects or aspects of our page transparent! This can be particularly useful for images, and can add something extra to your page design. The value you need to give the Opacity rule is between 0 and 1, with 0 being completely see-through, and 1 being completely solid. 

## Example 

To make a paragraph of text semi-transparent, I could do something like this:

```css
p {
    opacity: 0.5; 
}
```

If you want to know more about the `opacity` feature, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_transparency.asp). Both of these sites give excellent examples of how the opacity property works, with plenty of examples on how to use it, and how the feature looks on a website.

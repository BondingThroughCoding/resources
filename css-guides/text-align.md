# Text Align 

`text-align`, like a Word or Google Doc, can be used to change the way your text is formatted on a page. This can be very important, as the way you display information on a page can affect a viewers understanding of your content. If you want your text to appear like it usually does, that means your text is aligned to the `left`. If you want the opposite of this, then you can align your text to the `right`. If you want it smack-bang in the middle of the page, you can use `center`, and if you want it to fill all the space you've provided, you can use `justify`

## Example

I can use `text-align` to change the way my heading looks on the page: 

```css
h1 {
    text-align: center; 
}
```

If you want to know more about the `text-align` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.php). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the text-align CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

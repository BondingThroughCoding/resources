# Height

`height` does the same as `width`, except making our image taller or shorter, instead of thicker or thinner. Height also uses pixels or percentages, and is often used alongside width to control the size of images.  

## Example

I can use width to specify how wide I want my image to be! 

```css
img {
    height: 50%; 
}
```

You can also give height the `auto` value, which will change the image based on the size available for the image. This can be especially useful if you want your image height to be changeable. 

If you want to know more about the `height` property, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_height.php). Both of these sites give excellent examples of the height CSS property that are interactive, and allow you to change and alter the values to see how the property works.

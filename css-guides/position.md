# Position
`position` is a property that is used to determine how something sits in the webpage. I usually use this for images, but you can use it for text boxes too! It has a bunch of different values, and is often used alongside top, left, right, and bottom, which are used to set the permanent position of the image. There are also different settings for `position`, such as `relative`, `absolute`, and `sticky` to name a few. 

## Example
If I wanted to specify the position of an image, it would look like this! 

```css
img {
    position: relative; 
    top: 60px; 
    left: 30px; 
}
```

If you want to know more about the `Position` feature, you can go to the links at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) or [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp). Both of these sites give excellent examples of how the position property works, with plenty of examples on how to use them.

    <h2>What is TF2?</h2>
    <p>
        Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a multiplayer first-person shooter game developed
        and published by Valve Corporation in 2007. It is the sequel to the 1996
        Team Fortress mod for Quake and its 1999 remake, Team Fortress Classic.
        The game was released in October 2007 as part of The Orange Box for
        Microsoft Windows and the Xbox 360, and was ported to the PlayStation 3 in
        December 2007. It was released as a standalone game for Windows in
        April 2008, and updated to support macOS in June 2010 and Linux in
        February 2013. It was made free-to-play in June 2011, and is distributed
        online through Valve's digital retailer, Steam.</p>
    <p>Players join one of two teams—RED and BLU—and choose one of nine character classes to play as in game modes such
        as capture the flag and king of the hill. Its development was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, the developers
        of the original Team Fortress mod. Team Fortress 2 was announced in 1998 under the name Team Fortress 2:
        Brotherhood of Arms. Initially, the game had more realistic, militaristic visuals and gameplay, but this changed
        over the protracted nine years of development. After Valve released no information for six years, Team Fortress
        2 regularly featured in Wired News's annual vaporware list. Finally released on the Source game engine in 2007,
        Team Fortress 2 preserved much of the core class-based gameplay of its predecessors while featuring an
        overhauled, cartoon-like visual style influenced by the works of J. C. Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell, and Norman
        Rockwell, alongside an increased focus on the visual and verbal characterization of its playable classes and
        what the developers have described as a 1960s spy film aesthetic. <a href="file://claudius.science.mq.edu.au/4rpd111-PC13-Guest/.Desktop/Theo/Gamemodes.html">More info:</a> </p>

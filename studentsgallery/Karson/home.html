      Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by
      Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by
      themselves or other users. It was created by David Baszucki and Erik
      Cassel in 2004, and released to the public in 2006. As of July 2020, the
      platform has over 164 million monthly active users, including half of all
      American children under the age of 16.

      The platform hosts millions of user-created games (officially referred to
      as "experiences"), all created using a dialect of the programming language
      Lua and the platform's game engine, Roblox Studio. While Roblox is
      free-to-play, it features in-game purchases done through its virtual
      currency known as Robux, and game developers on the platform are able to
      create items that cost Robux. Furthermore, the platform hosts a large
      virtual economy centered around those items and Robux. Using the
      platform's "Developer Exchange" program, creators on the platform are able
      to exchange their earned Robux for real-world currency. The platform has
      also been used to host virtual concerts and events, as well as advergames.

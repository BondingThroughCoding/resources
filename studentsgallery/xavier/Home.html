    <h3>Hamilton Island</h3>

    <p>
      There's plenty to do during your Great Barrier Reef holiday on Hamilton
      Island. You can enjoy a wide selection of bars and restaurants, year-round
      cultural exhibitions and performances, an abundance of water sports and
      activities - and that's just the start. For sailing enthusiasts, there’s
      the Hamilton Island Yacht Club, and for keen golfers, the Hamilton Island
      Golf Club is the only Australian 18-hole championship course on its own
      island. Plus, with six different levels of accommodation to choose from
      across the island - ranging from plush, couples’ suites, to
      family-friendly apartments and holiday homes, a holiday on Hamilton Island
      really does offer something for everyone.

      To ensure you don’t miss out on our incredible activities, we recommend
      pre-booking ahead of your stay.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <tr>
            <th>The participation of the Soviet Union to World War 2 was largely spearheaded by Germany's international
                rivalry
                with the
                nation. An earlier pact had reinforced their political relationship, but with the successful attack on
                France
                and Poland, Hitler's forces were redirected towards the German-Soviet border. Operation Barbarossa was
                the code name for Nazi Germany's critical invasion of the Soviet Union, launched on
                June 22, 1941. It involved a three separate German forces attacking across a vast front, aiming to
                capture vital
                territory and resources, and ultimately destroy the Soviet Union's immense industrial presence. While
                initially
                successful, the operation ultimately failed to achieve its goals and became a major turning point in
                World War
                II.A lack of consideration for the Eastern winter further exacerbated supply problems, disrupting the
                Nazi
                conquest of the USSR. This failure became the largest and costliest military offensive in history, with
                around
                10 million combatants taking part in the opening phase and over 8 million casualties by the end of the
                operation
                on 5 December 1941. It marked a major escalation of World War II, opened the Eastern Front(the largest
                and
                deadliest land war in history),and brought the Soviet Union into the Allied powers.</th>

    <h2>The Gathering Storm</h2>

    <br />


    <br />

    <p> World War 1 had been a national humiliation for Germany, losing a large majority of their land to Alliead
        countries. The rise of Adolf Hitler and his right-wing extremist Nazi party opened new doors to revenge
        against
        old enemies. Hitler's policy of lebensraum fuelled public aggression against Slavic ethnicities, as he
        carefully
        planned his invasion of Russia. The combined force of Allied armies would have crushed the German army, so
        Germany opted for a peace pact with the Soviet Union. With the conquest of France and Poland, Hitler now
        turned
        his attention to his country's deep hatred of the Soviet Union.</p>

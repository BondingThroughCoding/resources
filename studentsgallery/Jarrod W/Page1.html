    <h2>Invasion</h2>
    <p>The operation, code-named after the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa ("red beard"), put into action Nazi
        Germany's ideological goals of eradicating communism and conquering the western Soviet Union to repopulate it
        with Germans under Generalplan Ost, which planned for the extermination of the native Slavic peoples by mass
        deportation to Siberia, Germanisation, enslavement, and genocide. The material targets of the invasion were the
        agricultural and mineral resources of territories such as Ukraine and Byelorussia and oil fields in the
        Caucasus. The Axis eventually captured five million Soviet Red Army troops on the Eastern Front and deliberately
        starved to death or otherwise killed million prisoners of war, as well as millions of civilians. Mass shootings
        and gassing operations, carried out by German paramilitary death squads and collaborators, murdered over a
        million Soviet Jews as part of the Holocaust. In the two years leading up to the invasion, Nazi Germany and the
        Soviet Union signed political and economic pacts for strategic purposes. Following the Soviet occupation of
        Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in July 1940, the German High Command began planning an invasion of the
        country, which was approved by Adolf Hitler in December. In early 1941, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, despite
        receiving intelligence about an imminent attack, did not order a mobilization of the Red Army, fearing that it
        might provoke Germany. As a result, Soviet forces were largely caught unprepared when the invasion began, with
        many units positioned poorly and understrength.

    <p>The invasion began on 22 June 1941 with a massive ground and air assault. The main part of Army Group South
        invaded from occupied Poland on 22 June, and on 2 July was joined by a combination of German and Romanian forces
        attacking from Romania. Kiev was captured on 19 September, which was followed by the captures of Kharkov on 24
        October and Rostov-on-Don on 20 November, by which time most of Crimea had been captured and Sevastopol put
        under siege. Army Group North overran the Baltic lands, and on 8 September 1941 began a siege of Leningrad with
        Finnish forces that ultimately lasted until 1944. Army Group Centre, the strongest of the three groups, captured
        Smolensk in late July 1941 before beginning a drive on Moscow on 2 October. Facing logistical problems with
        supply, slowed by muddy terrain, not fully outfitted for Russia's brutal winter, and coping with determined
        Soviet resistance, Army Group Center's offensive stalled at the city's outskirts by 5 December, at which point
        the Soviets began a major counteroffensive.

        The failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of Nazi Germany. Operationally, it achieved
        significant victories and occupied some of the most important economic regions of the Soviet Union, captured
        millions of prisoners, and inflicted heavy casualties. The German high command anticipated a quick collapse of
        resistance as in the invasion of Poland, but instead the Red Army absorbed the German Wehrmacht's strongest
        blows and bogged it down in a war of attrition for which Germany was unprepared. Following the heavy losses and
        logistical strain of Barbarossa, German forces could no longer attack along the entire front, and their
        subsequent operations—such as Case Blue in 1942 and Operation Citadel in 1943—ultimately failed.</p>

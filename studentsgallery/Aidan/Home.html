      The Nintendo Switch 2[b] is an upcoming hybrid video game console
      developed by Nintendo, and scheduled for release in most territories on
      June 5, 2025. The Switch 2 entered development in 2019, with a focus on
      backwards compatibility with Switch games. Like the original Nintendo
      Switch, the Switch 2 uses different modes that enables the device to
      either be used a portable handheld, a tablet-like device, or docked when
      connected to an external display, using detachable Joy-Con controllers to
      switch between modes. Switch 2 features enhancements of its predecessor
      including a larger liquid-crystal display, more internal storage, and
      updated Joy-Con controllers, dubbed Joy-Con 2, which now attach to the
      system horizontally. It allows for 1080p resolution and a 120 Hz refresh
      rate in handheld or tabletop mode and 4K resolution at 60 frames per
      second while docked.

      Games will be available through physical game cards and Nintendo's digital
      eShop. Certain games offer physical versions called Game-Key Cards, which
      lack any data on the card itself and requires the user to download its
      contents via the internet. Select Switch games can use the improved Switch
      2 performance through either free or paid updates. The Switch 2 also
      retains the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service required for some
      multiplayer games, and to provide access to the Nintendo Classics library
      of emulated games from older consoles; Nintendo GameCube games were
      announced as exclusive to the Switch 2 under the Expansion Pack tier. The
      new C-button on the righthand Joy-Con 2 controller enables GameChat, a
      feature that allows players to chat remotely, share their screens, and
      include footage from a webcam accessory.

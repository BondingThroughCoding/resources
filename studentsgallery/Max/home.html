    <h3>Why you should use Jemu</h3>
    <p id="p1">
        Jemu stands for Jeremy’s Exciting Money Stealing Utility Shop. Do you want free AirPods? If yes, download Jemu for free Airpods! And if you spend $1000 dollars, you can spend 1 second with King JEREMY! So come down to Jemu and get your free computers. If you jump out of a plane with no parachute and survive, you get a free Playstation 59 and GTA 12 early! Not to mention you also get the brand new Iphone 27 for free,fresh from the sweatshops! 
        
        But wait — there's more! Every 7th customer gets a mysterious box that may or may not contain a live Skibidi Toilet.
        Suggest Jemu to a friend and we’ll ship you a solid gold spoon with Jeremy’s face engraved on it.
        Use code "WHATISJEMU" to unlock the secret underground level of our store.
        We’re open 25 hours a day, 8 days a week — logic is optional.

        A province of the Italian Republic is composed of many municipalities
        (comune). Usually several provinces together form a region; the region of
        Aosta Valley is the sole exceptionâ€”it is not subdivided into provinces,
        and provincial functions are exercised by the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three main functions devolved to provinces are: Local planning and
        zoning Provision of local police and fire services Transportation
        regulation (car registration, maintenance of local roads, etc.) The number
        of provinces in Italy has been steadily growing in recent years, as many
        new ones are carved out of older ones. Usually, the province's name is the
        same as that of its capital city.

        While the cuisine of Spain may not be as well-known stateside as that of its European cousins, Italy and France, it deserves to be. The essence of Spanish cooking technique is taking the fabulous ingredients the country produces, such as its vibrant olive oil, fresh seafood, juicy tomatoes, world-class ham, and doing the bare minimum to transform them into simple, yummy dishes. When the products you're working with are as good as those available to Spanish cooks, doing too much to them is unnecessary, and even disrespectful.

<p>It's kind of a misnomer to say that there is one cuisine called "Spanish food." As we dive into this list, you'll notice that many of these dishes come from distinct areas within Spain, including the Andalucia, Galicia, Catalonia, and Basque regions. Although it's hard to capture the breadth of Spanish regional cuisine in any form shorter than a book, these 20 dishes might be considered the greatest hits.

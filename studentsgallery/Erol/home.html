    <p>
        Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and
        nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all
        known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[20]). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not
        providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules
        contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the
        oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°.[21] In liquid form, H2O is also called "water" at standard temperature and
        pressure.

        Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, a
        liquid, and a gas.[22] It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds
        consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may
        precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.

# About Bonding Through Coding

Bonding Through Coding is a program designed to introduce kids to the fundamentals of web development. Through fun and interactive guides, we teach kids aged 10-12 how to build their own web pages using HTML and CSS!

- maybe made a guide for github
- a guide for vscode
- a set of extra question and answer for kids to do after the workshop
